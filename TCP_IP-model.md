## 1️⃣ Application Layer (L4)

- Handles:
  - User interactions
  - Data formatting
  - Encryption and decryption
  - Session management
- **Important Protocols:**
  - HTTP
  - HTTPS
  - FTP
  - SMTP
  - SSH
  - DNS

---

## 2️⃣ Transport Layer (L3)

- Breaks data into segments
- Ensures data delivery and flow control
- **Important Protocols:**
  - TCP (reliable but slower)
  - UDP (faster, no delivery guarantee)

---

## 3️⃣ Internet Layer (L2)

- Responsible for routing using IP addresses
- Finds best path using routers
- **Important Protocols:**
  - IP
  - ICMP

---

## 4️⃣ Network Access Layer (L1)

- Transfers data physically as raw bits (0s and 1s)
- Uses:
  - Cables
  - Fiber optics
  - Ethernet
  - Wireless signals
