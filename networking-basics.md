# 🌐 Networking Basics

## ✅ What is Networking?

A network is a collection of devices (nodes) that communicate with each other so they can transfer data or resources via a communication medium (wired or wireless) using standard rules (protocols).

## ➡️ Without Networking

Without networking, there would be:
- ❌ No internet
- ❌ No web browsing
- ❌ No email
- ❌ No file sharing

> 💡 **Note**  
> Data travels in the form of packets (which improves efficiency and reliability) through routers and switches, following networking protocols.

## ✅ Types of Network

1. **PAN** – Personal Area Network  
2. **LAN** – Local Area Network  
3. **MAN** – Metropolitan Area Network  
4. **WAN** – Wide Area Network  

---

## 1️⃣ PAN (Personal Area Network)

- Connects devices within a very short range (generally **1m–10m**)
- Easy to set up
- Very low cost
- Mostly wireless
- **Technologies used:** Bluetooth, USB/Tethering (file transfer)




---

## 2️⃣ LAN (Local Area Network)

- Connects devices within a small area such as:
  - Home
  - Office
  - School
  - EC2 instances inside the same subnet
- High speed
- Low latency



---

## 3️⃣ MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)

- Connects multiple LANs within a city or large campus
- Medium speed
- More expensive than LAN



---

## 4️⃣ WAN (Wide Area Network)

- Connects networks over very large geographical areas
- Examples:
  - Internet
  - Bank networks across countries
  - Cloud providers’ global networks
- Lower speed compared to LAN
- Higher latency
